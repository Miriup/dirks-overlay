Dirks personal Gentoo overlay

This is the first overlay I ever created and for a long time it was my primary overlay where everything went into. I'm still using it heavily, however these days mainly for applications that aren't specifically related to a topic and have more to do with classical "system administration". Older ebuilds typically won't work anymore and at some point I'll have to weed out those old ebuilds.

A lot of time I copy "gentoo" main tree ebuilds with a version "9999" here to be able to modify the actual softwares against their source code repository. In these cases I try to leave the ebuilds nearly unchanged to keep compatibility (and make patches easy) with "upstream".

You will also find some stuff I modified in the Gentoo Bug Tracker.
